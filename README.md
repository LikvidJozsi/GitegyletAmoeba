# Gitegylet - Amoeba

This is the homework repository for Attila Juhos(<NEPTUN), Péter Tóth(<NEPTUN>) and Dávid Bánóczi(W87ORP) for the 2019 fall semester
deep learning course at BME.

# Amoeba

The goal of this project is to use deep reinforcement learning to train an Amoeba (aka. TicTacToe) playing agent. The variant of the game
used is one with an unbounded map with the goal of getting a five long continous amoeba. Initially instead of an unbounded one,
a sufficiently large map is used, since unbounded maps come with extra complexity for the agents.
